# System Requirements

## REQ-SYS-01: Platform

The game shall be accessible using a web browser.
It shall run under Android, Windows, and iOS using the default web browsers.

## REQ-SYS-02: Game Design

The game shall be a 2D platformer.

## REQ-SYS-03: Level Setup

A level shall be created based on an uploaded or taken photo, i.e., an image.
The image's visible edges will be the ground for the player character to move on.
The image shall still be visible as background.
The player shall choose one of three generated biome/layout previews before starting, as specified by REQ-LVL-12.
Placement shall prioritize safe support nearest a randomly selected edge and a distant start, rejecting walking-only pairs and trying alternatives as specified by REQ-LVL-07.

## REQ-SYS-04: Gameplay

The main goal of the game is for the character to get to the exit as fast as possible.
As soon as the character is moved by the player, a timer shall start.
Pressing jump to launch shall also start the timer (see REQ-MOV-05).
As soon as the character has reached the exit, the timer shall stop.

## REQ-SYS-05: Player Name

After game startup or initial access, the player shall be prompted to enter their name.
The player name shall be letters and spaces only, with a maximum length of 32 characters.

## REQ-SYS-06: Leaderboard

After successfully reaching the exit, the player shall see their time.
Along the time, a leaderboard with the top 10 lowest times for this level shall be shown with the respective player name.
Leaderboard entries shall be stored in the browser and shall not be shared
with other devices or browsers.
The exact just-completed attempt shall have a clearly outlined row labeled "Your run".
If that attempt does not enter the top ten, it shall appear beneath the ranked entries with no rank, without persisting an eleventh score.
Identical names and times shall not cause another attempt to be highlighted.
Existing attempts shall precede new attempts with equal times.

## REQ-SYS-08: Restart Run

The game shall provide a reset control to start the current level over.
It shall be available during play and after completion. Reset shall retain
the photo, player name, and saved leaderboard entries, restore the original
terrain and starting position, clear held controls, and reset the timer to
zero. An abandoned run shall not record a score.

## REQ-SYS-09: Falling Out of the Level

Status: Superseded by REQ-SYS-14.

Bottom-edge contact after falling shall reset the entire run under REQ-SYS-14.

## REQ-SYS-10: Enemy Contact

Status: Approved.

Contact with any flying patrol enemy shall immediately reset the entire run as specified by REQ-SYS-14.
The reset shall restore the original terrain, selected starting position, initial enemy patrol positions, fresh movement state, and zero timer, and shall clear held controls.
Enemy contact shall take priority over simultaneous finish contact and shall not record a score.
Manual reset shall continue to restore terrain, enemy starting positions, controls, and the timer under REQ-SYS-08.

## REQ-SYS-14: Run Reset on Failure

Status: Approved.

Enemy contact or reaching the image bottom after falling shall immediately reset the entire run.
The reset shall restore the original undrilled terrain, the selected starting position, initial enemy positions, fresh movement and pickup state, and a zero timer.
Held controls shall be cleared, and the failed run shall not be recorded.
The player character shall not be initially positioned against any image border.
The player may touch other image borders during play.

## REQ-SYS-15: Sequential Two-Player Sessions

Status: Approved.

The setup shall collect valid names for two players.
After each completed round, the game shall allow selection of which of the two players plays the next round.
Both players in the session shall play the same exact generated level option, including terrain, biome, start, finish, moving platforms, pickups, and enemies.
Starting the next round shall reset the selected option to its original state and start its timer at zero.
Each completed round shall be attributed to the name of the selected player.

## REQ-SYS-16: Prominent Gameplay Controls

Status: Approved.

The gameplay controls and instructions shall be visually prominent and easy to find.
Their visual grouping and text shall remain readable and usable on desktop and narrow/mobile viewports.

## REQ-SYS-11: Static Root Entry Point

Status: Approved.

The game shall load directly at the project root URL, including when hosted beneath a GitHub Pages repository path.
The entry page shall load local assets and ES modules using project-relative paths without requiring a build or backend.

## REQ-SYS-12: GitHub Feedback

Status: Approved.

The game shall offer Bug report, Feature request, and General feedback buttons during setup, play, and completion.
A severity selector shall offer Low, Medium, High, and Critical for every feedback category, initially selecting Medium.
Each button shall open the repository's GitHub issue form in a new tab with its category and selected severity prefilled.
The form shall collect written feedback and optional reproduction steps.
The team member shall review and submit the issue while signed in to GitHub, which shall record their GitHub account as the author.
The UI shall explain that submission happens on GitHub and that feedback visibility follows repository visibility.
Feedback controls shall support keyboard interaction without triggering game movement, drilling, or jumping.
The game shall not embed GitHub credentials or automatically include the photo, player name, or scores in feedback.
Deployed feedback links shall also prefill the source branch and full commit SHA of the deployed game.
The feedback UI shall display this version metadata and preserve it when category or severity changes.
Unstamped local copies shall explicitly identify their version as not injected rather than guessing a branch or commit.

## REQ-SYS-13: Versioned Pages Deployment

Status: Approved.

Pushes to `develop` shall deploy the game to the repository's single GitHub Pages site through GitHub Actions.
Other branches shall not trigger this deployment.
The deployment shall inject the triggering source branch and full commit SHA into the published entry page.
The published artifact shall contain only the game entry page and runtime assets, without repository credentials or development files.
Missing or invalid deployment metadata shall fail the build rather than publish an unidentified version.
